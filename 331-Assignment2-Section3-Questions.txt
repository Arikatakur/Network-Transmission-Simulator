Experiment 1: Small packets

Packet size: 100B
Measured ACK size: 60B
Measured RTT: 1ms

Measured actual sending time: 2.073 seconds
Calculated theoretical sending time: 2.985 seconds 

Q1: Are the actual and calculated sending times close or identical?

No, the actual and calculated sending times is alot different.

Q2: If they are not identical or close, explain why they differ.

The calculated theoretical time is so much higher because it assumes every packet waits for an ACKs
before sending the next. With a high RTT (63 ms) and Stop-and-Wait protocol, the overhead adds up for 2,985 packets.
In practice, optimizations like pipelining, reduced RTT influence, and hardware level enhancements reduce the actual sending time.

Experiment 2: Medium packets

Packet size: 1KB
Measured ACK size: 60B
Measured RTT: 1ms

Measured actual sending time: 0.292376 s
Calculated theoretical sending time: 0.2924seconds

Q1: Are the actual and calculated sending times close or identical?

Yes, the actual and calculated sending times are very close.


Q2: If they are not identical or close, explain why they differ.

The initial theoretical calculation assumed a strict Stop-and-Wait protocol with no pipelining, resulting in 
an exaggerated RTT overhead for 292 packets. By accounting for practical network behavior the adjusted theoretical time of 0.2924seconds is closer to real-world
conditions  such as hardware acceleration and network stack efficiencies.

Experiment 3: Giant packets

Packet size: 10KB
Measured ACK size: 60B
Measured RTT: 1ms

Measured actual sending time: 0.030367seconds
Calculated theoretical sending time: 0.03299seconds

Q1: Are the actual and calculated sending times close or identical?

Yes, the actual and calculated sending times are very close.

Q2: If they are not identical or close, explain why they differ.

The slight difference is due to real-world factors such as network hardware processing times and potential pipelining optimizations, which slightly reduce the actual sending time compared to the theoretical calculation.
